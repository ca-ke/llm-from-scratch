GPT Loader System Analysis
=========================

The GPT loader system consists of several interconnected components:

1. GPTDataset (gpt_dataset.py):
- A PyTorch Dataset implementation
- Takes a tokenizer as input
- Creates chunks of text with a sliding window approach
- Stores input and target IDs for training
- Key methods:
    * create_chunks(): Creates overlapping sequences with specified length and stride
    * __getitem__(): Returns input and target pairs for training

2. CreateDataLoader (create_dataloader.py):
- Wraps the GPTDataset with PyTorch's DataLoader
- Provides configuration for:
    * batch_size (default: 2)
    * shuffle (default: True)
    * drop_last (default: True)
    * num_workers (default: 0)

3. Tokenization System:
- Has multiple tokenization strategies (WhitespaceTokenizationStrategy, RegexTokenizationStrategy, BPETokenizationStrategy)
- BPE (Byte Pair Encoding) is the main implementation used in the project
- Features include:
    * Vocabulary management
    * Special token handling
    * Training of merge rules
    * Encoding and decoding capabilities

System Flow (as seen in main.py):
1. Text is loaded from a file
2. BPE tokenization strategy is initialized and trained
3. A tokenizer is created with the strategy
4. GPTDataset is created with the tokenizer
5. Text is chunked into sequences
6. DataLoader is created to batch and shuffle the data

Implementation Best Practices:
- Using proper abstraction layers
- Implementing standard PyTorch interfaces
- Providing configurable parameters
- Supporting different tokenization strategies
- Including special token handling
- Using efficient data loading mechanisms
